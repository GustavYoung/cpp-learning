Testing Kek
I think i might create an array to test my knowledge of both arrays and  the getline functions

Thank you Lord Skeltal
Update : so apparently the streams gets exhausted after reaching the EOF (end of file), so i had to create another stream to read this file.
That was purely speculation on my part but i suppose that's what happened!
