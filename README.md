# Doing me a big'ol learning of C++
A bunch of learning programs from OpenClassrooms website
Bear in mind though, i'm switching between french and english heh.
I honestly don't think that's going to be a problem though.
Puisque je suis pratiquement le seul Ã lire ce `README.md`

## Sample code
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main
{
	int answer(42);
	cout << "Were you not taught that that 'using namespace std was a bad bad habit ?!!!" << endl;
	cout << "Heck yer lyfe kiddo !" << endl;
}
